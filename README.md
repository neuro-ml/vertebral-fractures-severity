This repository contains annotated vertebrae heights for 100 randomly selected 
images from the [MoscowRadiology-CTLungCa-500](https://mosmed.ai/en/datasets/ct_lungcancer_500/)
dataset. 

The annotation was prepared for the paper [Keypoints Localization for Joint Vertebra Detection and Fracture Severity Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11960) 
and was used to train and evaluate the vertebrae fractures detection algorithm. 

We urge the community to use the dataset and annotation in their research 
in order to be able to compare different methods for vertebrae fractures detection.

# Usage

`example.py` contains an example of matching the annotation with images from the dataset.
